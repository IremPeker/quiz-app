## Tech/Library used

This project was built by using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [creating a production build](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/production-build/) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

See the section about [eject](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/available-scripts/#npm-run-eject) for more information.

## Unit Tests

For the unit tests, [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) is used as a Javascript testing framework. Also [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) is used to test React components.
